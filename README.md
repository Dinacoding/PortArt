# PortArt

## About

PortArt is a restaurant made for people who want a journey into the heart of extraordinary flavours. It is a branding website that brings the essence and unique experience that casual dining can bring. The objective of the PortArt is and develop a sense of trust, aiming to get them as regular customers and attract new customers to make reservation.[This is my live link](https://dinacoding.github.io/PortArt/)

## Planning

- This mind map is the foundation for my "PortArt" restaurant website. I'm using it to visualize the entire user journey, from the moment someone lands on the homepage to when they make a reservation or explore our menu. The "PortArt," branches out into key sections like "About Us," "Menu," "Contact," and "Visit us". Each branch further subdivides into specific pages, considering factors like user flow and ease of navigation. For example, under "Menu," I've mapped out subsections for "starter," "Mains" and "Desserts". This mind map ensures a well-organized and intuitive website structure, making it easy for our guests to find the information they need and ultimately, choose to dine with PortArt.
Also how did I prioritise my workload and workflow.

## Designer Choices

### Color scheme

This color palette offers a sophisticated and versatile touch to the project and enhance the design. The bordeaux and a lighter shade provide a rich and elegant aspect while the beige and soft cream bring a sense of calm and neutrality. The charcoal gray and slate gray and the depth and subtle element. All together they create a balanced and harmonious look helping me achieving a polished work.
