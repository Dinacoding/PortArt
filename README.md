## Designer Choices

### Color scheme
This color palette offers a sophisticated and versatile touch to the project and enhance the design. The bordeaux and a lighter shade provide a rice and elegant aspect while the beige and soft cream bring a sense of calm and neutrality. The charcoal gray and slate gray and the depth and subtle element. All together they create a balanced and harmonious look helping me achieving a polished work.
